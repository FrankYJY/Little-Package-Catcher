# Little-Package-Catcher
a primary imitation of wireshark, pure personal work.
Java x JavaFX (fxml)

My project for Computer Networks, can sniff and send packages, with a little bug.
Welcome to be my cooperator, if you can do some further work such as:
expand to more protocals,
statistic and analysis,
perfect the sending part,
deal with the bug.
If you conform to the above conditions(really do something), you can submit your work with base of this program. Otherwise, it's just for common learning and reference.

Code annotations were wrote in Chinese, but explanation was wrote in English. Please try online translation.
